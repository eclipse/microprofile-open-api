This MicroProfile specification aims at providing a unified Java API for the link:++https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md++[OpenAPI v3 specification],
that all application developers can use to expose their API documentation.

* The link:++https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/tree/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/openapi++[spec APIs] are composed of annotations, models, and programming interfaces.
* The link:++https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/microprofile-openapi-spec.adoc++[spec documentation] outlines the rules and boundaries of the spec.
