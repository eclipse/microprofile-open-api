= MicroProfile OpenAPI Specification

== Introduction
Exposing APIs has become an essential part of all modern applications.  At the
center of this revolution known as the API Economy we find RESTful APIs, which can
transform any application into language agnostic services that can be called from
anywhere: on-premises, private cloud, public cloud, etc.

For the clients and providers of these services to connect there needs to be a
clear and complete contract.  Similar to the WSDL contract for legacy Web Services,
the https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md[OpenAPI v3] specification is the contract for
RESTful Services.

This MicroProfile specification, called OpenAPI 1.0, aims to provide a set of Java
interfaces and programming models which allow Java developers to natively produce
OpenAPI v3 documents from their JAX-RS applications.

== Architecture

There are different ways to augment a JAX-RS application in order to produce an
OpenAPI document, which are described in <<Documentation Mechanisms>>.  The picture
below provides a quick overview of the different types of components that make up
the MP OpenAPI specification:


![alternate text](https://sourceforge.net/images/icon_linux.gif)

The remaining sections of this specification will go into the details of each component.

== Configuration

Configuration of various parts of this specification is provided via the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config] mechanism,
which means that vendors implementing the MP OpenAPI specification must also implement
the MP Config specification.

There are various ways to inject these configuration values into an MP OpenAPI
framework, including the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/configsources.asciidoc#default-configources[default ConfigSource] as well as
https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/configsources.asciidoc#custom-configsources[custom ConfigSource].

Vendors implementing the MP OpenAPI specification can also provide additional native
ways for these configuration values to be injected into the framework
(e.g. via a server configuration file), as long as they also implement the MP Config
specification.


=== List of configurable items

Vendors must support all the <<Core configurations>> of this specification.
Optionally, they may also support <<Vendor extensions>> that allow the configuration of
framework-specific values for configurations that affect implementation behavior.

For convenience of vendors (and application developers using custom ConfigSources),
the full list of supported configuration keys is available as constants in the
https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/openapi/OASConfig.java[OASConfig] class.

==== Core configurations

The following is a list of configuration values that every vendor must support.

[cols="1,4"]
|===
| Config key | Value description

| `mp.openapi.model.reader` | Configuration property to specify the fully qualified name of the <<OASModelReader>> implementation.
| `mp.openapi.filter` | Configuration property to specify the fully qualified name of the <<OASFilter>> implementation.
| `mp.openapi.scan.disable`  |  Configuration property to disable annotation scanning. Default value is `false`.
| `mp.openapi.scan.packages`  |  Configuration property to specify the list of packages to scan. For example,
`mp.openapi.scan.packages=com.xyz.PackageA,com.xyz.PackageB`
| `mp.openapi.scan.classes`  |  Configuration property to specify the list of classes to scan. For example,
`mp.openapi.scan.classes=com.xyz.MyClassA,com.xyz.MyClassB`
| `mp.openapi.scan.exclude.packages`  |  Configuration property to specify the list of packages to exclude from scans. For example,
`mp.openapi.scan.exclude.packages=com.xyz.PackageC,com.xyz.PackageD`
| `mp.openapi.scan.exclude.classes`  |  Configuration property to specify the list of classes to exclude from scans. For example,
`mp.openapi.scan.exclude.classes=com.xyz.MyClassC,com.xyz.MyClassD`
| `mp.openapi.servers`  |  Configuration property to specify the list of global servers that provide connectivity information. For example,
`mp.openapi.servers=https://xyz.com/v1,https://abc.com/v1`
| `mp.openapi.servers.path.`   |  Prefix of the configuration property to specify an alternative list of servers to service all operations in a path. For example,
`mp.openapi.servers.path./airlines/bookings/{id}=https://xyz.io/v1`
| `mp.openapi.servers.operation.` | Prefix of the configuration property to specify an alternative list of servers to service an operation.
Operations that want to specify an alternative list of servers must define an `operationId`, a unique string used to identify the operation. For example,
`mp.openapi.servers.operation.getBooking=https://abc.io/v1`
|===

==== Vendor extensions

Vendors that wish to provide vendor-specific configuration via MP Config (instead
of another native configuration framework) must use the prefix `mp.openapi.extensions`.

== Documentation Mechanisms

There are many different ways to provide input for the generation of the resulting
OpenAPI document.

The easiest way to get started is via the <<Annotations>>, since
they augment (not replace) the existing JAX-RS annotations.  Using annotations means
developers don't have to re-write the portions of the OpenAPI document that are
already covered by the JAX-RS framework (e.g. the HTTP method of an operation).

Another way to document your APIs is via <<Static OpenAPI files>>.  This
is often adopted by enterprises that want to lock-in the contract of the API
before any code is written.  In this case, we refer to the OpenAPI document as the
"source of truth", by which the client and provider must abide.

The MP OpenAPI specification also defines a <<Programming model>> that allows
application developers to provide a bootstrap (or complete) OpenAPI model tree.

Lastly, a <<Filter>> is described which can update the OpenAPI model after it has
been built from the previously described documentation mechanisms.

=== Annotations

Many of these annotations were derived from the https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core[Swagger Core] library, which
allows for a mostly-mechanical transformation of applications that are using that
library and wish to take advantage to the official MP OpenAPI interfaces.

==== Quick overview of annotations

The following annotations are found in the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/tree/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/openapi/annotations[org.eclipse.microprofile.openapi.annotations] package.

[cols="1,4"]

| Annotation | Description

| https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/openapi/annotations/Operation.java[@Operation] | Describes an operation or typically a HTTP method against a specific path.
| https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/openapi/annotations/servers/Server.java[@Server]|  Represents a Server used in an operation or used by all operations in an OpenAPI document.

=== Static OpenAPI files

Application developers may wish to include a pre-generated OpenAPI document that
was written separately from the code (e.g. with an editor such as https://editor.swagger.io/[this]).

Depending on the scenario, the document may be fully complete or partially complete.
If a document is fully complete then the application developer will want to set the
`mp.openapi.scan.disable` configuration property to `true`.  If a document is partially
complete, then the application developer will need to augment the OpenAPI snippet
with annotations, programming model, or via the filter.

==== Location and formats

Vendors are required to fetch a single document with extension of `yml`, `yaml` or
`json`, inside the application's `META-INF/openapi` folder.  If there is more than
one document found that matches one of these extensions the behavior of which file
is chosen is undefined (i.e. each vendor may implement their own logic), which means
that application developers should only place a single document into that folder.

=== Programming model

Application developers are able to provide OpenAPI elements via Java POJOs. The
complete set of models are found in the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/tree/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/openapi/models[org.eclipse.microprofile.openapi.models] package.

==== OASFactory

The https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/openapi/OASFactory.java[OASFactory] is used to create all of the elements of an OpenAPI tree.

For example, the following snippet creates a simple https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/openapi/models/info/Info.java[Info] element that contains a title, description, and version.

[source,java]
----
OASFactory.createObject(Info.class).title("Airlines").description("Airlines APIs").version("1.0.0");
----

==== OASModelReader

The https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/openapi/OASModelReader.java[OASModelReader] interface allows application developers to bootstrap the OpenAPI model tree
used by the processing framework.  To use it, simply create an implementation of
this interface and register it using the `mp.openapi.model.reader` configuration
key, where the value is the fully qualified name of the reader class.

.Sample META-INF/microprofile-config.properties
[code,property]
----
mp.openapi.model.reader=com.mypackage.MyModelReader
----

Similar to static files, the model reader can be used to provide either complete
or partial model trees. If providing a complete OpenAPI model tree, application
developers should set the `mp.openapi.scan.disable` configuration to `true`.
Oherwise this partial model will be used as the base model during the processing
of the other <<Documentation Mechanisms>>.

Vendors are required to call the OASReader a single time, in the order defined by
the <<Processing rules>> section.  Only a single OASReader instance is allowed per
application.

=== Filter

There are many scenarios where application developers may wish to update or remove
certain elements and fields of the OpenAPI document.  This is done via a filter,
which is called once after all other documentation mechanisms have completed.

==== OASFilter

The https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/openapi/OASFilter.java[OASFilter] interface allows application developers
to receive callbacks for various key OpenAPI elements.  The interface has a default
implementation for every method, which allows application developers to only override
the methods they care about.  To use it, simply create an implementation of
this interface and register it using the `mp.openapi.filter` configuration
key, where the value is the fully qualified name of the filter class.

.Sample META-INF/microprofile-config.properties
[code,property]
----
mp.openapi.filter=com.mypackage.MyFilter
----

Vendors are required to call all registered filters in the application (0..N) once
for each filtered element.  For example, the method `filterPathItem` is
called *for each* corresponding `PathItem` element in the model tree.  This allows
application developers to filter the element and any of its descendants.

The order of filter methods called is undefined, with two exceptions:

1.  All filterable descendant elements of a filtered element must be called before its ancestor.
2.  The `filterOpenAPI` method must be the *last* method called on a filter (which
is just a specialization of the first exception).

TODO: Document solution from issue #56 once ready

=== Processing rules

The processed document available from the <<OpenAPI Endpoint>> is built from a variety of sources,
which were outlined in the sub-headings of <<Documentation Mechanisms>>.  Vendors
are required to process these different sources in the following order:

1. Fetch configuration values from `mp.openapi` namespace
2. Call OASModelReader
3. Fetch static OpenAPI file
4. Process annotations
5. Filter model via OASFilter

==== Validation

The MP OpenAPI 1.0 specification does not mandate vendors to validate the resulting
OpenAPI v3 model (after processing the 5 steps previously mentioned), which means
that the behavior of invalid models is vendor specific (i.e. vendors may choose to
ignore, reject, or pass-through invalid inputs).


**Example processing**:

* A vendor starts by fetching all available <<Configuration>>.  If
an `OASModelReader` was specified in that configuration list, its `buildModel`
method is called to form the starting OpenAPI model tree for this application.
* Any <<Vendor specific configuration>> are added on top of that starting model (overriding
conflicts), or create a new model if an `OASModelReader` was not registered.
* The vendor searches for a file as defined in the section <<Static OpenAPI files>>.
If found, it will read that document and merge with the model produced by previous
processing steps (if any), where conflicting elements from the static file will override
the values from the original model.
* If annotation scanning was not disabled, the JAX-RS and OpenAPI annotations from
the application will be processed, further overriding any conflicting elements
from the current model.
* The final model is filtered by walking the model tree and invoking all registered
<<OASFilter>> classes.

== OpenAPI Endpoint

=== Overview
A fully processed and valid OpenAPI document must be available at the root
URL `/openapi`, as a `HTTP GET` operation.

For example, `GET http://myHost:myPort/openapi`.

This document represents the result of the applied <<Processing rules>>.

=== Content format
The default `Content-Type` of the `/openapi` endpoint is `application/yaml`.

Vendors must also support the type `application/json` if requested via the
`Accept` header.

=== Query parameters
No query parameters are required for the `/openapi` endpoint.  However, one
suggested but optional query parameter for vendors to support is `format`,
where the value can be either `json` or `yaml`, to facilitate the toggle between
the default `yaml` format and `json` format.

=== Context root behaviour
Vendors are required to ensure that the combination of each global https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#serverObject[server]
element and https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#pathItemObject[pathItem] element resolve to the absolute backend URL of that
particular path.  If that `pathItem` contains a `servers` element , then this
list of operation-level `server` elements replaces the global list of servers
for that particular `pathItem`.

For example:  an application may have an `ApplicationPath` annotation with the
value of `/`, but is assigned the context root of `/myApp` during deployment. In
this case, the `server` elements (either global or operation-level) must either
end with `/myApp` or a corresponding proxy.  Alternatively it is valid, but discouraged, to
add that context root (`/myApp`) to every `pathItem` defined in that application.

=== Multiple applications

The 1.0 version of the MicroProfile OpenAPI specification does not define how
the `/openapi` endpoint may be partitioned in the event that the MicroProfile
runtime supports deployment of multiple applications. If an implementation wishes
to support multiple applications within a MicroProfile runtime, the semantics of
the `/openapi` endpoint are expected to be the logical AND of all the applications
in the runtime, which would imply merging multiple OpenAPI documents into a single
valid document (handling conflicting IDs and unique names).


== Limitations

=== Internationalization
The 1.0 version of the MicroProfile OpenAPI spec does not require vendors to
support multiple languages based on the `Accept-Language`.  One reasonable
approach is for vendors to support unique keys (instead of hardcoded text) via
the various <<Documentation Mechanisms>>, so that the implementing framework can
perform a global replacement of the keys with the language-specific text that
matches the `Accept-Language` request for the `/openapi` endpoint.  A cache of
processed languages can be kept to improve performance.
