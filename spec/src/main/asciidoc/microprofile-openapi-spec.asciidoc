== Introduction
Exposing APIs has become an essential part of all modern applications.  At the
center of this revolution known as the API Economy we find RESTful APIs, which can
transform any application into language agnostic services that can be called from
anywhere: on-premises, private cloud, public cloud, etc.

For the clients and providers of these services to connect there needs to be a
clear and complete contract.  Similar to the WSDL contract for legacy Web Services,
the https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md[OpenAPI v3] specification is the contract for
RESTful Services.

This MicroProfile specification, called OpenAPI 1.0, aims to provide a set of Java
interfaces and programming models which allow Java developers to natively produce
OpenAPI v3 documents from their JAX-RS applications.

== Architecture

There are different ways to augment a JAX-RS application in order to produce an
OpenAPI document, which are described in <<Documentation Mechanisms>>.  The picture
below provides a quick overview of the different types of components that make up
the MP OpenAPI specification:

:imagesdir: images
image::diagram.png[Architecture Diagram]

The remaining sections of this specification will go into the details of each component.

== Configuration

Configuration of various parts of this specification is provided via the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config] mechanism,
which means that vendors implementing the MP OpenAPI specification must also implement
the MP Config specification.

There are various ways to inject these configuration values into an MP OpenAPI
framework, including the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/configsources.asciidoc#default-configources[default ConfigSource] as well as
https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/configsources.asciidoc#custom-configsources[custom ConfigSource].

Vendors implementing the MP OpenAPI specification can optionally provide additional native
ways for these configuration values to be injected into the framework
(e.g. via a server configuration file), as long as they also implement the MP Config
specification.


=== List of configurable items

Vendors must support all the <<Core configurations>> of this specification.
Optionally, they may also support <<Vendor extensions>> that allow the configuration of
framework-specific values for configurations that affect implementation behavior.

For convenience of vendors (and application developers using custom ConfigSources),
the full list of supported configuration keys is available as constants in the
https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/openapi/OASConfig.java[OASConfig] class.

==== Core configurations

The following is a list of configuration values that every vendor must support.

`mp.openapi.model.reader`::
Configuration property to specify the fully qualified name of the <<OASModelReader>> implementation.

`mp.openapi.filter`::
Configuration property to specify the fully qualified name of the <<OASFilter>> implementation.

`mp.openapi.scan.disable`::
Configuration property to disable annotation scanning. Default value is `false`.

`mp.openapi.scan.packages`:: 
Configuration property to specify the list of packages to scan. For example,
`mp.openapi.scan.packages=com.xyz.PackageA,com.xyz.PackageB`

`mp.openapi.scan.classes`::
Configuration property to specify the list of classes to scan. For example,
`mp.openapi.scan.classes=com.xyz.MyClassA,com.xyz.MyClassB`

`mp.openapi.scan.exclude.packages`::
Configuration property to specify the list of packages to exclude from scans. For example,
`mp.openapi.scan.exclude.packages=com.xyz.PackageC,com.xyz.PackageD`

`mp.openapi.scan.exclude.classes`::
Configuration property to specify the list of classes to exclude from scans. For example,
`mp.openapi.scan.exclude.classes=com.xyz.MyClassC,com.xyz.MyClassD`

`mp.openapi.servers`::
Configuration property to specify the list of global servers that provide connectivity information. For example,
`mp.openapi.servers=https://xyz.com/v1,https://abc.com/v1`

`mp.openapi.servers.path.`::
Prefix of the configuration property to specify an alternative list of servers to service all operations in a path. For example,
`mp.openapi.servers.path./airlines/bookings/{id}=https://xyz.io/v1`

`mp.openapi.servers.operation.`::
Prefix of the configuration property to specify an alternative list of servers to service an operation.
Operations that want to specify an alternative list of servers must define an `operationId`, a unique string used to identify the operation. For example,
`mp.openapi.servers.operation.getBooking=https://abc.io/v1`

`mp.openapi.schema.`::
Prefix of the configuration property to specify a schema for a specific class, in JSON format.
The remainder of the property key must be the fully-qualified class name. The value must be a valid OpenAPI schema object, 
specified in the JSON format. The use of this property is functionally equivalent to the use of the `@Schema` annotation on
a Java class, but may be used in cases where the application developer does not have access to the source code of a class. +
+
When a `name` key is provided with a string value, the schema will be added to the `schemas` collection in the `components`
object of the resulting OpenAPI document using ``name``'s value as the key.
+
For example, in the case where an application wishes to represent Java ``Date``s in epoch milliseconds, the following configuration could be used (line 
escapes and indentation added for readability):
[source, json]
----
mp.openapi.schema.java.util.Date = { \
  "name": "EpochMillis" \
  "type": "number", \
  "format": "int64", \
  "description": "Milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT" \
}
----

==== Vendor extensions

Vendors that wish to provide vendor-specific configuration via MP Config (instead
of another native configuration framework) must use the prefix `mp.openapi.extensions`.

== Documentation Mechanisms

There are many different ways to provide input for the generation of the resulting
OpenAPI document.

The MP OpenAPI specification requires vendors to produce a valid OpenAPI document
from pure JAX-RS 2.0 applications.  This means that vendors must process all the
relevant JAX-RS annotations (such as `@Path` and `@Consumes`) as well as Java objects
(POJOs) used as input or output to JAX-RS operations.  This is a good place to
start for application developers that are new to OpenAPI: just deploy your existing
JAX-RS application into a MP OpenAPI vendor and check out the output from `/openapi`!

The application developer then has a few choices:

1.  Augment those JAX-RS annotations with the
OpenAPI <<Annotations>>.  Using annotations means
developers don't have to re-write the portions of the OpenAPI document that are
already covered by the JAX-RS framework (e.g. the HTTP method of an operation).

2. Take the initial output from `/openapi` as a starting point to document
your APIs via <<Static OpenAPI files>>.  It's worth mentioning that these static
files can also be written before any code, which is an approach often adopted by
enterprises that want to lock-in the contract of the API.  In this case, we refer
to the OpenAPI document as the "source of truth", by which the client and provider
must abide.

3. Use the <<Programming model>> to provide a bootstrap (or complete)
OpenAPI model tree.

Additionally, a <<Filter>> is described which can update the OpenAPI model after it has
been built from the previously described documentation mechanisms.

=== Annotations

Many of these OpenAPI v3 annotations were derived from the https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core[Swagger Core] library, which
allows for a mostly-mechanical transformation of applications that are using that
library and wish to take advantage to the official MP OpenAPI interfaces.

==== Quick overview of annotations

===== Overrides

When the same annotation is used on a class and a method, the values from the
method instance will take precedence for that particular method.  This commonly
occurs with the `@Server` and `@Tag` annotations.

In other cases, such as with `@Parameter` and `@RequestBody`, the annotation values
from the method's parameters takes precedence over corresponding annotation values
from the method itself - in this scenario the combined usage of these annotations is
allowed but discouraged, as it is error prone.

The `@Schema` annotation has a complex set of possible combinations.  It can placed
on POJOs (and their fields / methods) and referenced from many other annotations.
In the event that a `@Schema#implementation` value points to a POJO that also contains
a `@Schema` annotation, the values are merged but with precedence given to
the referrer annotation (i.e. the one that contains the `implementation` key).
This allows POJO models to be reusable and configurable.

=== Static OpenAPI files

Application developers may wish to include a pre-generated OpenAPI document that
was written separately from the code (e.g. with an editor such as https://editor.swagger.io/[this]).

Depending on the scenario, the document may be fully complete or partially complete.
If a document is fully complete then the application developer will want to set the
`mp.openapi.scan.disable` configuration property to `true`.  If a document is partially
complete, then the application developer will need to augment the OpenAPI snippet
with annotations, programming model, or via the filter.

==== Location and formats

Vendors are required to fetch a single document named `openapi` with an extension
of `yml`, `yaml` or `json`, inside the application module's root
`META-INF` folder.  If there is more than one document found that matches one of
these extensions the behavior of which file is chosen is undefined (i.e. each vendor
may implement their own logic), which means that application developers should
only place a single `openapi` document into that folder.

For convenience, you may also place your `microprofile-config.properties` in the
root `META-INF` folder, if you wish to keep both documents in the same directory.
This is in addition to the default locations defined by https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config].

=== Programming model

Application developers are able to provide OpenAPI elements via Java POJOs. The
complete set of models are found in the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/tree/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/openapi/models[org.eclipse.microprofile.openapi.models] package.

==== OASFactory

The https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/openapi/OASFactory.java[OASFactory] is used to create all of the elements of an OpenAPI tree.

For example, the following snippet creates a simple https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/openapi/models/info/Info.java[Info] element that contains a title, description, and version.

[source,java]
----
OASFactory.createObject(Info.class).title("Airlines").description("Airlines APIs").version("1.0.0");
----

==== OASModelReader

The https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/openapi/OASModelReader.java[OASModelReader] interface allows application developers to bootstrap the OpenAPI model tree
used by the processing framework.  To use it, simply create an implementation of
this interface and register it using the `mp.openapi.model.reader` configuration
key, where the value is the fully qualified name of the reader class.

.Sample META-INF/microprofile-config.properties
[source,property]
----
mp.openapi.model.reader=com.mypackage.MyModelReader
----

Similar to static files, the model reader can be used to provide either complete
or partial model trees. If providing a complete OpenAPI model tree, application
developers should set the `mp.openapi.scan.disable` configuration to `true`.
Otherwise this partial model will be used as the base model during the processing
of the other <<Documentation Mechanisms>>.

Vendors are required to call the OASReader a single time, in the order defined by
the <<Processing rules>> section.  Only a single OASReader instance is allowed per
application.

=== Filter

There are many scenarios where application developers may wish to update or remove
certain elements and fields of the OpenAPI document.  This is done via a filter,
which is called once after all other documentation mechanisms have completed.

==== OASFilter

The https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/openapi/OASFilter.java[OASFilter] interface allows application developers
to receive callbacks for various key OpenAPI elements.  The interface has a default
implementation for every method, which allows application developers to only override
the methods they care about.  To use it, simply create an implementation of
this interface and register it using the `mp.openapi.filter` configuration
key, where the value is the fully qualified name of the filter class.

.Sample META-INF/microprofile-config.properties
[source,property]
----
mp.openapi.filter=com.mypackage.MyFilter
----

Vendors are required to call the registered filter once for each filtered element.
For example, the method `filterPathItem` is called *for each* corresponding `PathItem`
element in the model tree.  This allows application developers to filter the element
and any of its descendants.

The order of filter methods called is undefined, with two exceptions:

1.  All filterable descendant elements of a filtered element must be called before its ancestor.
2.  The `filterOpenAPI` method must be the *last* method called on a filter (which
is just a specialization of the first exception).

=== Processing rules

The processed document available from the <<OpenAPI Endpoint>> is built from a variety of sources,
which were outlined in the sub-headings of <<Documentation Mechanisms>>.  Vendors
are required to process these different sources in the following order:

1. Fetch configuration values from `mp.openapi` namespace
2. Call OASModelReader
3. Fetch static OpenAPI file
4. Process annotations
5. Filter model via OASFilter

**Example processing**:

* A vendor starts by fetching all available <<Configuration>>.  If
an `OASModelReader` was specified in that configuration list, its `buildModel`
method is called to form the starting OpenAPI model tree for this application.
* Any <<Vendor extensions>> are added on top of that starting model (overriding
conflicts), or create a new model if an `OASModelReader` was not registered.
* The vendor searches for a file as defined in the section <<Static OpenAPI files>>.
If found, it will read that document and merge with the model produced by previous
processing steps (if any), where conflicting elements from the static file will override
the values from the original model.
* If annotation scanning was not disabled, the JAX-RS and OpenAPI annotations from
the application will be processed, further overriding any conflicting elements
from the current model.
* The final model is filtered by walking the model tree and invoking all registered
<<OASFilter>> classes.

== OpenAPI Endpoint

=== Overview
A fully processed OpenAPI document must be available at the root
URL `/openapi`, as a `HTTP GET` operation.

For example, `GET http://myHost:myPort/openapi`.

This document represents the result of the applied <<Processing rules>>.

The protocol required is `http`.  Vendors are encouraged, but not required, to
support the `https` protocol as well, to enable a secure connection to the OpenAPI
endpoint.

=== Content format
The default format of the `/openapi` endpoint is `YAML`.

Vendors must also support the `JSON` format if the request contains an `Accept`
header with a value of `application/json`, in which case the response must contain
a `Content-Type` header with a value of `application/json`.

=== Query parameters
No query parameters are required for the `/openapi` endpoint.  However, one
suggested but optional query parameter for vendors to support is `format`,
where the value can be either `JSON` or `YAML`, to facilitate the toggle between
the default `YAML` format and `JSON` format.

=== Context root behavior
Vendors are required to ensure that the combination of each global https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#serverObject[server]
element and https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#pathItemObject[pathItem] element resolve to the absolute backend URL of that
particular path.  If that `pathItem` contains a `servers` element , then this
list of operation-level `server` elements replaces the global list of servers
for that particular `pathItem`.

For example:  an application may have an `ApplicationPath` annotation with the
value of `/`, but is assigned the context root of `/myApp` during deployment. In
this case, the `server` elements (either global or operation-level) must either
end with `/myApp` or a corresponding proxy.  Alternatively it is valid, but discouraged, to
add that context root (`/myApp`) to every `pathItem` defined in that application.

=== Multiple applications

The 1.0 version of the MicroProfile OpenAPI specification does not define how
the `/openapi` endpoint may be partitioned in the event that the MicroProfile
runtime supports deployment of multiple applications. If an implementation wishes
to support multiple applications within a MicroProfile runtime, the semantics of
the `/openapi` endpoint are expected to be the logical union of all the applications
in the runtime, which would imply merging multiple OpenAPI documents into a single
valid document (handling conflicting IDs and unique names).

== Integration with other MicroProfile specifications

This section will outline specific integrations between MicroProfile OpenAPI and other MicroProfile specifications.

=== MicroProfile Rest Client

It is common that a microservice (A) using MicroProfile OpenAPI will also use https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-rest-client[MicroProfile Rest Client]
to make outbound calls into another microservice (B).  In this case, we do not want
the interface for microservice (B) to appear in microservice (A)'s OAS3 document.

Therefore, vendors are required to exclude from the final OAS3 document any interface annotated with https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-rest-client/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/rest/client/inject/RegisterRestClient.java[org.eclipse.microprofile.rest.client.inject.RegisterRestClient].

== Limitations

=== Internationalization
The 1.0 version of the MicroProfile OpenAPI spec does not require vendors to
support multiple languages based on the `Accept-Language`.  One reasonable
approach is for vendors to support unique keys (instead of hardcoded text) via
the various <<Documentation Mechanisms>>, so that the implementing framework can
perform a global replacement of the keys with the language-specific text that
matches the `Accept-Language` request for the `/openapi` endpoint.  A cache of
processed languages can be kept to improve performance.

=== Validation

The MP OpenAPI 1.0 specification does not mandate vendors to validate the resulting
OpenAPI v3 model (after processing the 5 steps previously mentioned), which means
that the behavior of invalid models is vendor specific (i.e. vendors may choose to
ignore, reject, or pass-through invalid inputs).

=== Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

The MP OpenAPI 1.0 specification does not require vendors to support https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/[CORS]
for the `/openapi` endpoint.  The behavior of CORS requests is implementation dependent.
