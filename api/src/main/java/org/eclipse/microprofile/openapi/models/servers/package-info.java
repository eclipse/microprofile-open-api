 * Model interfaces to represent servers used for a single API operation or for all operations in an OpenAPI document,
 * as well as a way to represent variables for server URL template substitution.
 * <p>
 * The behaviour of methods inherited from java.lang.Object are undefined by the MicroProfile OpenAPI specification.
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@literal}Override
 *  public OpenAPI buildModel() {
 *      return OASFactory.createOpenAPI()
 *              .addServer(OASFactory.createServer()
 *                      .url("https://{username}.example-server.com:8080/api")
 *                      .description("The production API server")
 *                      .addVariable("username", OASFactory.createServerVariable()
 *                              .defaultValue("user1")
 *                              .description("Reviews of the app by users")
 *                              .addEnumeration("user1")
